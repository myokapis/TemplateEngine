# Template Engine

Template Engine is a library that parses text templates and populates template fields with formatted data. It is compatible with ASP.Net MVC and Web Forms as well as Web API. Some of the features and advantages of Template Engine are:

 - Complete separation of code and mark up
 - All parts of the template are accessible and reusable which eliminates a plethora of partial views
 - Data can be bound to templates by convention which reduces the amount of code required
 - Repeating markup such as grids, tables, and drop down options can be bound to a collection and automatically rendered
 - Templates can be cached to improve performance
 - Custom formatting and localization are supported

## Getting Started
Template Engine is currently in beta. It will be released as a NuGet package once the beta code has been adequately proved. In the meantime, you are welcome to download the source code and build the project. There is a full suite of unit tests which can provide insight into how the library can be used. Full documentation will be added to this project as part of the first stable release.

Thank you to Niels Wojciech Tadeusz Andersen [haj@zhat.dk](haj@zhat.dk) for the TemplateEngine (C library) and TemplateEngine for .NET projects which I used for so many years. They provided the fundamental concepts that have been extended in this project.
